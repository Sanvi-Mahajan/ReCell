*ReCell*

this mini project provides a user friendly application where people can buy and sell old mobile ( second hand mobiles ).
In today's digital era, buying and selling used mobile phones online has become a popular trend due to affordability and convenience. The "ReCell" aims to simplify this process by 
providing a user-friendly platform that connects buyers and sellers of used smartphones. 
This web-based application allows users to register, browse available phones by category or search query, and view detailed item descriptions including price, condition, age, 
location, and seller information. Sellers can upload product details, manage their listings, and interact with potential buyers directly through a messaging system.
The project focuses on building an efficient and normalized relational database to handle user profiles, product listings, categories, messages, and transaction history. It 
implements core database concepts such as ER modelling, relational schema, 
primary/foreign keys, constraints, and SQL queries. To keep things simple, the payment system supports a simulated Cash On Delivery (COD) option and real-time payment (UPI). 
The main goal of this project is to develop a well-structured DBMS-driven application that is intuitive, scalable, and ideal for academic use and small-scale business simulation.
( the transaction processesing has not been implemented correctly ).
